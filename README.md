## Introduction

This project implements a basic neural network for binary classification. The network can be configured with any number of layers and neurons. The training process uses the sigmoid activation function and gradient descent optimization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bishwarup-Das/Building-Neural-Network-from-scratch.git
    cd Building-Neural-Network-from-scratch
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the file:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
